  <h1>About /MCHL_WRRN</h1>

  <p>
    /MCHL_WRRN is the web development autonym of me,<a target="_blank" href="http://linkedin.com/in/mdwarren"> Michael Warren</a>. I am a lifelong technology hobbyist that decided in 2014 to pursue a solid foundation in prominent web technologies including Ruby on Rails, which is my primary framework of choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    From my first static website built with HTML 4.0 and hosted on Tripod in 1998, to Wordpress landing pages and brochure sites, and now on to Rails apps, I've always enjoyed having a presence on the web. Today, I am making that presence known as I pursue personal and professional projects of much greater complexity.
